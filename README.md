# Python

This repository is a place to showcase some of my Python capabilities.

In this directory you will find:

* Suffix_Analyser: A Flask-based web-app that interacts with the Wolfram Alpha API. The app uses server-side events, a database, and Wolfram's RESTful API, parsing the XML response and extracting the appropriate XML fields.

* Titanic: A deep-learning challenge from Kaggle.com to predict whether passengers onboard the Titanic would have survived or not. The code is built using Google's Tensorflow framework, which I also used to work on the www.intelli.bet algorithm.
